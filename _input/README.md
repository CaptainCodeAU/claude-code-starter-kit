# Input Folder

Drop files, code, or folders here for processing into the starter kit.

## How It Works

1. Add your content to this folder
2. Start a Claude Code session
3. Ask Claude to read the main `CLAUDE.md` and examine this folder
4. Brainstorm together where the content fits best
5. Claude moves it to the appropriate location in `templates/.claude/`
6. Delete the original from here

## Before Pushing to GitHub

This folder should be **empty** before pushing. All content should be resolved and moved to its final location in `templates/.claude/`.
