TIPS FOR THIS FILE (delete this section when customizing):

1. Keep it lean - every word costs tokens (~50-150 tokens ideal)
2. Focus on what Claude needs to know to work effectively
3. Use skills for detailed instructions (they're lazy-loaded)
4. Use rules/ for always-on constraints (use sparingly)

For detailed guidance, see:
- Import syntax: @path/to/file imports content inline
- Path rules: Add YAML frontmatter with `paths:` to scope rules
