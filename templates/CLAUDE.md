TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS (delete this section when customizing):

This is the ROOT CLAUDE.md - it tells Claude about your PROJECT.
Keep it lean (~50-150 tokens ideal) - every word costs context.

There's also .claude/CLAUDE.md which tells Claude HOW TO WORK.
Together they give Claude both project context and workflow guidance.
